# 🤖📈 **Smart Career Counselor Platform (AI + Microservices + React + DevOps)**

### 🔍 **Problem Statement:**

People are confused about career choices. Based on a user’s skills, interests, and personality (via a form + resume), the system suggests suitable career paths using **AI/ML**, lets mentors post content, and allows users to ask questions in a forum.

## ⚙️ Jenkins + Docker + K8s Flow

1. Jenkins:

   - Pulls from GitHub
   - Runs tests
   - Builds Docker images
   - Pushes to DockerHub
   - Applies K8s manifests (`kubectl apply -f k8s/`)

2. Kubernetes:

   - All microservices run as separate deployments
   - Flask AI service exposed to Gateway via internal service
   - React served via NGINX deployment

## 🔄 Suggested Build Order

### ✅ Always Start with:

1. **Backend first**: Auth → Gateway → AI → Services
2. **Then Frontend**: So you have real APIs to connect
3. **Then DevOps**: Docker → Kubernetes → Jenkins → Monitoring
