### What is Spring?

**Spring** is a **powerful, lightweight, open-source framework** for building **Java applications**. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java apps and is particularly known for enabling easy development of **enterprise-level** applications.

At its core, Spring simplifies **Java development** by:

- Managing your application's infrastructure so you can focus on business logic.
- Promoting good design practices like **loose coupling**, **separation of concerns**, and **testability**.

---

### Why Was Spring Created? (Why is it "found")

Spring was created to solve several **problems with traditional Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)** development:

#### 1. **Complexity of Java EE (J2EE)**

Before Spring, developers used Java EE with tools like **EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans)**, which were:

- **Heavyweight** and complex.
- Hard to test.
- Hard to maintain and configure.

#### 2. **Tight Coupling**

Traditional Java apps often had tightly coupled components, making the code difficult to manage, test, and reuse.

Spring introduced **Dependency Injection (DI)** to decouple components and make code easier to manage and test.

#### 3. **Boilerplate Code**

Developers had to write a lot of repetitive code for things like:

- Transactions
- Database access
- Logging

Spring provided abstractions to **reduce boilerplate code** using modules like:

- Spring JDBC
- Spring ORM
- Spring AOP

#### 4. **Need for a Lightweight Alternative**

Spring is **non-invasive and lightweight**, meaning:

- You can use only the parts you need.
- It doesn’t force you into a particular programming model.
- You can test your code easily without starting a whole application server.

### What is Spring Boot?

**Spring Boot** is a **framework built on top of the Spring Framework** that helps you create **standalone**, **production-ready** Spring applications quickly with **minimal configuration**.

It is designed to **simplify** the development process by:

- Reducing boilerplate code
- Providing out-of-the-box defaults
- Automatically configuring commonly used components

---

### Why Use Spring Boot?

Traditional Spring development required a lot of manual configuration:

- XML files
- Web server setup
- Manual bean wiring

Spring Boot solves this with:

#### ✅ **Auto Configuration**

Automatically configures your application based on the libraries in your classpath.

#### ✅ **Embedded Servers**

No need to deploy WAR files. Spring Boot apps run with **embedded servers** like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.

#### ✅ **Starter Dependencies**

Predefined Maven/Gradle dependencies for common use-cases like:

- `spring-boot-starter-web`
- `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
- `spring-boot-starter-security`

#### ✅ **Production-Ready Features**

Includes monitoring, health checks, metrics, etc., using **Spring Boot Actuator**.

#### ✅ **Opinionated Defaults**

Spring Boot provides sensible defaults so you can get started quickly, but you can override them anytime.

### Key Features of Spring Boot

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **@SpringBootApplication** | Main annotation to start a Spring Boot app; combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` |
| **Embedded Server**        | Runs directly with an embedded Tomcat/Jetty — no need for external server                                               |
| **Spring Boot Starters**   | Predefined dependencies to reduce setup complexity                                                                      |
| **Spring Boot CLI**        | Command-line interface for quickly building Spring apps                                                                 |
| **Spring Boot Actuator**   | Provides endpoints for monitoring and managing the application                                                          |

### Basic Example

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

With `spring-boot-starter-web`, this single class can launch a full web application with an embedded Tomcat server!
