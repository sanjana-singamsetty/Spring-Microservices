## Why use **Spring Boot**?

### 1. **Simplifies Java backend development**

- Spring Framework is powerful but complex to configure.
- Spring Boot _auto-configures_ everything for you — so you can focus on writing your business logic, not setup.

### 2. **Quick project setup with minimal config**

- With Spring Boot, you get:

  - Built-in web server (Tomcat/Jetty)
  - Ready-to-use dependencies
  - Starter templates for common tasks like web apps, REST APIs, databases

### 3. **Microservices friendly**

- Ideal for building small, independent, scalable services.
- Helps organize your app better (great for modern cloud apps).

### 4. **Huge ecosystem and community**

- Tons of plugins, extensions, and support.
- Works well with databases, security, messaging, etc.

### 5. **Easy to run**

- Runs as a standalone Java app (no need for external server setup).
- You just run a `main()` method — no complex deployment needed.

### 6. **Production-ready features**

- Health checks, metrics, logging, and monitoring support built-in.

### TL;DR:

**Spring Boot saves time and effort, makes Java backend development easier, and helps build scalable, maintainable apps quickly.**
