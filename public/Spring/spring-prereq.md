## 🧠 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

### 🎯 Purpose

OOP helps organize code into reusable, modular, and maintainable components. It models real-world entities as objects, making complex systems easier to design and extend. Spring Boot leverages OOP to manage application components and their interactions.

Java is an OOP language. Understanding OOP is crucial for Spring Boot because it uses classes and objects to define and manage components.

### 🔹 Classes and Objects

- **Class**: A blueprint/template for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class, which holds actual data and behaviors.

```java
class Car {
    String color;
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car(); // object creation
        myCar.color = "Red";
        myCar.drive(); // method call
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Inheritance

#### 🎯 Purpose

Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing ones. It helps in building hierarchical relationships and reducing code duplication.

- Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class using the `extends` keyword.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Polymorphism

#### 🎯 Purpose

Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. This allows for flexible and extensible code, making it easier to introduce new behaviors.

- **Compile-time (Method Overloading)**: Same method name with different parameters.
- **Run-time (Method Overriding)**: Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method declared in its parent class.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Encapsulation

#### 🎯 Purpose

Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object by restricting direct access to its fields. It improves security, maintainability, and flexibility by exposing only necessary information through methods.

- Hiding internal details using access modifiers.
- Use private fields and public getter/setter methods.

```java
class Student {
    private int age;

    public void setAge(int a) {
        age = a;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Abstraction

#### 🎯 Purpose

Abstraction simplifies complex systems by exposing only essential features and hiding implementation details. It helps manage complexity and enables focus on high-level operations.

- Hiding complex logic and showing only necessary details.
- Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

---

## 🔄 2. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**

### 🎯 Purpose

Interfaces and abstract classes define contracts and shared behaviors for related classes. They enable loose coupling, code reuse, and flexibility in designing systems that can evolve over time.

### 🔹 Interface

- Defines a contract (what to do), but not how.
- All methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

class Bike implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Bike started");
    }
}
```

Great question! Let's clarify this clearly:

---

## ✅ Does an Interface **only** have abstract methods?

### 🔴 **Before Java 8**:

Yes — interfaces could **only** have:

- **Public static final constants**
- **Public abstract methods** (implicitly)

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound(); // implicitly public and abstract
}
```

---

### 🟢 **From Java 8 onwards**, interfaces can also have:

1. **Default Methods**
2. **Static Methods**

#### ✅ 1. **Default Methods** (have a body)

- Let you define a default implementation directly inside the interface.

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound(); // abstract

    default void breathe() {
        System.out.println("Breathing...");
    }
}
```

#### ✅ 2. **Static Methods**

- Belong to the interface and cannot be overridden.

```java
interface Animal {
    static void info() {
        System.out.println("Animals are living beings.");
    }
}
```

---

### 🟢 **From Java 9 onwards**, interfaces can also have:

3. **Private Methods**

   - Used to avoid code duplication in default methods.

```java
interface Animal {
    private void log() {
        System.out.println("Log entry");
    }

    default void show() {
        log(); // calling private method
    }
}
```

---

## 📌 Summary Table:

| Method Type  | Abstract | Default | Static | Private |
| ------------ | -------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| **Java < 8** | ✅       | ❌      | ❌     | ❌      |
| **Java 8+**  | ✅       | ✅      | ✅     | ❌      |
| **Java 9+**  | ✅       | ✅      | ✅     | ✅      |

---

### 🚀 Why this matters for Spring Boot?

Spring Boot relies heavily on interfaces (like `JpaRepository`, `CrudRepository`). These often come with **default** methods so you don’t need to implement basic behaviors yourself.

Let me know if you want examples from Spring showing these in action!

### 🔹 Abstract Class

- Can have both abstract (no body) and non-abstract (with body) methods.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();

    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Lion extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Roar");
    }
}
```

---

## 📚 3. **Java Collections Framework**

### 🎯 Purpose

Collections provide efficient ways to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects. They are essential for managing data, improving performance, and simplifying code in Java applications.

### Key Interfaces:

- **List** (ArrayList, LinkedList): Ordered collection
- **Set** (HashSet, TreeSet): Unique elements
- **Map** (HashMap, TreeMap): Key-value pairs

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Java");

Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("One", 1);
```

Used in Spring Boot for managing data collections, responses, etc.
Absolutely! Java Collections is a **core concept** in Java and is heavily used in **Spring Boot**, especially for managing and manipulating data. Let’s go step-by-step, covering everything with examples and clear purposes.

---

## 📚 **What is Java Collections Framework?**

The **Java Collections Framework (JCF)** is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable **data structures** such as:

- Lists
- Sets
- Maps
- Queues

These help store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data efficiently.

---

## 🧱 **Core Interfaces in Java Collections**

### 1. **List** (Allows duplicates and maintains order)

| Implementations | Description                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ArrayList`     | Fast for reading, backed by dynamic array |
| `LinkedList`    | Fast for inserting/deleting, uses nodes   |

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Alice");
names.add("Bob");
System.out.println(names.get(0)); // Alice
```

### 🔹 Purpose:

- Best when you need indexed access (like arrays) or frequent additions/removals.

---

### 2. **Set** (No duplicates, unordered or ordered depending on type)

| Implementations | Description                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `HashSet`       | No order guaranteed, fastest     |
| `LinkedHashSet` | Maintains insertion order        |
| `TreeSet`       | Maintains sorted (natural) order |

```java
Set<String> cities = new HashSet<>();
cities.add("Paris");
cities.add("London");
cities.add("Paris"); // Ignored: duplicate
```

### 🔹 Purpose:

- Useful when you want **unique elements** only.

---

### 3. **Map** (Key-Value pairs)

| Implementations | Description               |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `HashMap`       | Fastest, no order         |
| `TreeMap`       | Sorted by key             |
| `LinkedHashMap` | Maintains insertion order |

```java
Map<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();
scores.put("Alice", 90);
scores.put("Bob", 85);
System.out.println(scores.get("Alice")); // 90
```

### 🔹 Purpose:

- Excellent when you need to **associate keys with values**, like a dictionary.

---

### 4. **Queue** (FIFO structure)

| Implementations | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `LinkedList`    | Also works as a queue                          |
| `PriorityQueue` | Orders elements by natural order or comparator |

```java
Queue<String> tasks = new LinkedList<>();
tasks.offer("Task1");
tasks.offer("Task2");
System.out.println(tasks.poll()); // Task1
```

### 🔹 Purpose:

- Great for scheduling tasks, processing jobs, etc.

---

## 🔧 **Other Important Interfaces**

| Interface   | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Deque`     | Double-ended queue (insert/remove at both ends) |
| `SortedSet` | A `Set` with elements in order (TreeSet)        |
| `SortedMap` | A `Map` with keys in sorted order (TreeMap)     |

---

## 🛠️ **Utility Class – `Collections`**

Java provides a helper class `java.util.Collections` with utility methods:

```java
Collections.sort(list);
Collections.reverse(list);
Collections.shuffle(list);
Collections.max(list);
```

---

## 🔄 **Iteration Methods**

### Using `for-each` loop:

```java
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

### Using `Iterator`:

```java
Iterator<String> it = names.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(it.next());
}
```

---

## 🔥 Java 8 Stream API with Collections

```java
names.stream()
     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
     .forEach(System.out::println);
```

---

## 📌 Why Collections Matter in Spring Boot?

- `List`, `Set`, `Map` are used in:

  - DTOs, entities, controllers, services.
  - HTTP response and request bodies.
  - Processing DB results (e.g., `List<Product>`).
  - Handling configuration properties.

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Type  | Interface                     | Allows Duplicates | Maintains Order | Key Feature      |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| List  | `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`     | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes          | Indexed elements |
| Set   | `HashSet`, `TreeSet`          | ❌ No             | ❌/✅           | Unique elements  |
| Map   | `HashMap`, `TreeMap`          | ❌ Keys unique    | ❌/✅           | Key-value pairs  |
| Queue | `LinkedList`, `PriorityQueue` | ✅                | ✅ FIFO         | Scheduling       |

---

## 🚨 4. **Exception Handling**

### 🎯 Purpose

Exception handling ensures that your program can gracefully handle errors and unexpected situations without crashing. It improves reliability, user experience, and debugging.

### Syntax:

```java
try {
    // code that might throw exception
} catch (ExceptionType name) {
    // handling code
} finally {
    // code that always runs
}
```

### Custom Exceptions:

```java
class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String msg) {
        super(msg);
    }
}
```

Spring Boot uses `@ExceptionHandler` and `@ControllerAdvice` for global exception management.

---

## 🧪 5. **Java 8 Features**

### 🎯 Purpose

Java 8 features like lambdas, streams, and Optionals make code more concise, readable, and expressive. They enable functional programming, simplify data processing, and help avoid common errors.

### 🔹 Lambda Expressions

```java
// Traditional
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running...");
    }
};

// Lambda
Runnable r2 = () -> System.out.println("Running...");
```

### 🔹 Streams

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack");
names.stream().filter(name -> name.startsWith("J")).forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 🔹 Optional

Helps avoid `NullPointerException`.

```java
Optional<String> opt = Optional.ofNullable(null);
opt.ifPresent(System.out::println);
```

---

## 🏷️ 6. **Annotations**

### 🎯 Purpose

Annotations provide metadata that can be used by the compiler or frameworks to generate code, enforce rules, or configure behavior. In Spring Boot, annotations drive configuration and dependency injection.

Annotations provide metadata for your code.

### Common ones in Java:

- `@Override`: Indicates overriding a method
- `@FunctionalInterface`: Ensures only one abstract method
- `@Deprecated`: Marks a method as outdated

Spring Boot relies heavily on annotations like `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, `@Service`, etc.

---

---

## 📑 7. **Enums (Enumerations)**

### 🎯 Purpose

Enums restrict a variable to have only a set of predefined values, improving code safety, readability, and maintainability. They are used to represent fixed sets of constants, such as days or status codes.

Enums are special Java types used to define collections of constants. They make your code more readable and less error-prone by restricting a variable to have one of only a few predefined values.

### Example:

```java
enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}

Day today = Day.MONDAY;
```

**Use cases:**

- Representing days of the week, status codes, user roles, etc.
- In Spring Boot, enums are often used in REST APIs to represent fixed sets of values, such as order status or user type.

---

## 💾 8. **I/O (Input/Output) and Serialization**

### 🎯 Purpose

I/O enables reading from and writing to files, networks, and other sources, which is essential for data persistence and communication. Serialization allows objects to be converted into a format for storage or transmission and later reconstructed.

### File I/O

Java provides classes for reading from and writing to files. This is essential for tasks like configuration, logging, or data persistence.

#### Example: Reading a file

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
String line = br.readLine();
br.close();
```

### Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting a Java object into a format (like JSON or binary) that can be easily stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the reverse process.

- **Spring Boot** uses libraries like **Jackson** to automatically convert Java objects to JSON (serialization) and JSON to Java objects (deserialization) in REST APIs.

#### Example: Object to JSON

```java
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(myObject);
```

---

**Serialization** is the process of converting an object (like a class instance in Java) into a format that can be **easily stored** or **transmitted**, and then later **reconstructed (deserialized)**.

---

## 🧠 **Purpose of Serialization (Why do we need it?)**

| Purpose                  | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔄 **Persistence**       | Save the state of an object to a file or database (e.g., game save data, session info).    |
| 🌐 **Communication**     | Send objects over a network (e.g., in distributed systems or APIs).                        |
| 🗃️ **Caching**           | Store an object in cache (like Redis or memory) and reload it later without recomputation. |
| 🧪 **Testing & Logging** | Easily log the state of objects for debugging or testing purposes.                         |
| 🔄 **Deep Cloning**      | Some apps use serialization to deep-copy objects.                                          |

---

## 🧱 **In Java specifically**

Java provides a built-in mechanism for serialization via the `java.io.Serializable` interface.

### ✅ Example:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Student implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor, Getters, Setters
}
```

Now, this `Student` object can be:

- **Written to a file** (as a `.ser` or binary file)
- **Sent over a socket/network**
- **Stored in a cache**

---

## 💡 Real-Life Use Cases

1. ✅ **Spring Boot** – DTOs or session-related objects might be serialized when working with Redis, session stores, or messaging queues.
2. ✅ **REST APIs** – Objects are serialized into JSON or XML for HTTP responses.
3. ✅ **JPA Entities** – When storing them or caching, serialization helps in converting the object state.
4. ✅ **Message Queues** – Kafka or RabbitMQ may serialize objects for transmission.

---

## 🚫 When You Don’t Need It

- If you're just using the object temporarily in memory.
- If you’re using stateless microservices (most data will go via REST, not Java object serialization).

---

## 🚀 Summary

> **Serialization = Convert object → storable or transferable format.** > **Deserialization = Convert back → object.**

It's vital for **data persistence**, **network communication**, **distributed systems**, and **caching** — all of which are common in **Spring Boot** applications.

Let me know if you'd like a working Java serialization/deserialization example!

## 🧵 9. **Multithreading Basics**

### 🎯 Purpose

Multithreading allows programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness. It's essential for building scalable and efficient applications.

Multithreading allows Java programs to perform multiple tasks at the same time, improving performance and responsiveness.

### Example: Creating a thread

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in thread");
    }
}

MyThread t = new MyThread();
t.start();
```

- In Spring Boot, you can run tasks asynchronously using the `@Async` annotation, which internally uses threads.

---

## 📦 10. **Packages and Access Modifiers**

### 🎯 Purpose

Packages organize code into logical groups, making it easier to manage and avoid naming conflicts. Access modifiers control visibility, enhancing security and encapsulation.

### Packages

Packages are used to organize related classes and interfaces, preventing naming conflicts and making code easier to maintain.

```java
package com.myapp.model;
```

### Access Modifiers

Control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables:

- `public`: Accessible from anywhere
- `private`: Accessible only within the same class
- `protected`: Accessible within the same package and subclasses
- (default, no modifier): Accessible within the same package

---

## 🔧 11. **Build Tools (Maven/Gradle)**

### 🎯 Purpose

Build tools automate compiling, testing, packaging, and managing dependencies. They streamline the development process and ensure consistent builds for Java and Spring Boot projects.

Build tools help manage dependencies, compile code, run tests, and package applications.

- **Maven** and **Gradle** are the most popular build tools for Java and Spring Boot projects.

### Maven Example

The `pom.xml` file defines dependencies and project configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Great questions, Sanju! These are **fundamental concepts** in Java. Let me break it down for you clearly:

---

## ✅ Why Do We Use **Constructors**?

### ➤ What is a constructor?

A **constructor** is a special method in a class that runs **automatically when you create an object**.

### ➤ Why use it?

To **initialize** (give values to) object fields at the time of creation.

### 🔧 Example without constructor:

```java
Pizza p = new Pizza();
p.setId(1);
p.setName("Veggie");
p.setPrice(250.0);
```

### 🔧 With constructor:

```java
Pizza p = new Pizza(1, "Veggie", 250.0);
```

🟢 **Constructor saves time, improves readability, and ensures object is created with valid values.**

---

## ✅ Why Do We **Override** Methods?

### ➤ What is overriding?

When a **subclass or same class** provides a **custom version** of a method already defined in the parent class (like `Object.toString()`), it’s called **overriding**.

### ➤ Why override `toString()`?

By default:

```java
System.out.println(pizza);
```

prints something like:

```
Pizza@7dc36524
```

Not useful, right?

When we override:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Pizza{id=" + id + ", name=" + name + ", price=" + price + "}";
}
```

Now it prints:

```
Pizza{id=1, name=Veggie, price=250.0}
```

✅ **Makes debugging, logging, and displaying objects easier and meaningful.**

---

### 🔁 Summary:

| Concept         | Why We Use It                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constructor** | To initialize object data at creation time                                |
| **Overriding**  | To give custom behavior to methods (like printing meaningful object data) |

---

## 🔄 **Override ante enti?**

**"Already unda method ni manam marchadam."**

Java lo `Object` ane base class undi. Every class ki automatic ga `toString()` method untadi.

Kaani adi **boring ga** print chestundi — like this:

```
Pizza@5e91993f
```

🤨 Emi artham kadu kada?

So… **manaki nachina vidham ga print cheyyali ante, override cheyyali**!

---

### 🔸 Example:

```java
class Pizza {
    int id;
    String name;
    double price;

    // Override toString()
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Pizza: " + name + " - ₹" + price;
    }
}
```

Appudu:

```java
Pizza p = new Pizza();
p.name = "Margherita";
p.price = 299;
System.out.println(p);
```

👉 Output:

```
Pizza: Margherita - ₹299.0
```

🎉 **Now it’s clear, readable, and user-friendly!**

---

## ✅ Simple Analogy:

**Example:**

Ni ID card lo just "ID1234" ani unte boring kada?

Kaani “Sanjana Singamsetty | Student | Amrita University” ani unte baaguntadi kada?

🟢 _That's what overriding `toString()` does — gives a meaningful identity to the object._

---

Inko sari:

| Word         | Meaning                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Override** | Already unda method ni marchadam (like `toString()`) |
| **Why?**     | Object ni chakkaga, clear ga print cheyyadam kosam   |

---

Great question! Let's break it down **super simple** so you understand **why we use enums in Java**:

---

### 🧠 **What is an Enum?**

An `enum` (short for "enumeration") is a special type in Java used to define **a set of named constant values**.

---

### ✅ **Why Use Enums?**

#### 1. **Fixed Set of Values**

Enums are best when your variable can have **only a limited number of possible values**.

🧠 Example: Pizza sizes

```java
SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE
```

Using a `String`:

```java
pizza.setSize("smaal");  // oops, typo — but Java won't catch it!
```

Using an `enum`:

```java
pizza.setSize(PizzaSize.SMALL); // only valid values allowed!
```

---

#### 2. **Type Safety**

Java will **prevent invalid values** when you use enums.

```java
PizzaSize size = PizzaSize.MEDIUM; // ✅ valid
PizzaSize size = "Medium";         // ❌ Error: not type-safe
```

---

#### 3. **Code Readability**

Enums make your code more readable and meaningful:

```java
if (order.getStatus() == OrderStatus.CANCELLED) {
    // Handle cancelled order
}
```

vs

```java
if (order.getStatus().equals("canceleded")) {
    // risky & confusing spelling
}
```

---

#### 4. **Easy to Use in Switch Statements**

```java
switch (pizza.getSize()) {
    case SMALL: System.out.println("Small Pizza!"); break;
    case MEDIUM: System.out.println("Medium Pizza!"); break;
    case LARGE: System.out.println("Large Pizza!"); break;
}
```

---

### 🧁 Bonus: Enums Can Have Fields & Methods!

Enums in Java can even store extra data.

```java
public enum PizzaSize {
    SMALL(8), MEDIUM(10), LARGE(12);

    private final int inches;

    PizzaSize(int inches) {
        this.inches = inches;
    }

    public int getInches() {
        return inches;
    }
}
```

---

### TL;DR: **Why Use Enums?**

✔ Prevents invalid values
✔ More readable, maintainable code
✔ Safer than strings or integers
✔ Helps with cleaner logic and UI handling

---

Want to try creating `OrderStatus` enum next?

Great question! Let's break down **why and how** we use this custom exception class in Java:

---

## 🔥 Why We Use `InvalidPizzaPriceException`

In Java, exceptions are used to handle **unusual or error situations** in a clean and controlled way. Sometimes, **built-in exceptions** like `IllegalArgumentException` or `NullPointerException` don’t clearly explain what's wrong in your specific application.

So we create **custom exceptions** like:

```java
InvalidPizzaPriceException
```

To **signal specific problems** in our app — in this case: ❌ **invalid (negative) pizza price**.

---

## 🧱 Code Breakdown

```java
public class InvalidPizzaPriceException extends Exception {
```

This says:

> “I’m creating a **custom exception** that behaves like other exceptions in Java, but with my own name and meaning.”

It extends the built-in `Exception` class (i.e., it's a **checked exception**, which means it **must be handled or declared with `throws`**).

---

```java
    public InvalidPizzaPriceException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
```

- This is a **constructor**.
- It calls `super(message)`, which means it’s passing the message (like "Pizza price cannot be negative!") to the parent `Exception` class.
- That message can later be retrieved using `getMessage()` in a catch block.

### ✅ Example Usage

**Throwing the custom exception:**

```java
if (price < 0) {
    throw new InvalidPizzaPriceException("Pizza price cannot be negative!");
}
```

**Catching it:**

```java
try {
    Pizza pizza = new Pizza("Veggie", 101, -99, PizzaSize.MEDIUM, OrderStatus.PREPARING);
} catch (InvalidPizzaPriceException e) {
    System.out.println("❌ Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## 🧠 Summary

| Part                       | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `extends Exception`        | Makes it a **checked exception**                  |
| Custom class name          | Describes the specific issue clearly              |
| Constructor with `super()` | Passes message to base `Exception`                |
| Usage                      | Helps **handle app-specific errors** meaningfully |

Let me know if you want to convert it to an **unchecked exception** (`extends RuntimeException`) or want a visual flow of how this works!
