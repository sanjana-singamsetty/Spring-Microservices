## ⚙️ **1. Monolithic Architecture**

### ✅ Best For:

| Scenario                  | Why Monolith Is Suitable                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Small or Medium App**   | Easier to develop, deploy, and test in one codebase. |
| **Startup or MVP**        | Fast iteration, fewer moving parts, simpler hosting. |
| **Small team**            | No need for team coordination across services.       |
| **Simple business logic** | Doesn’t need independent scaling or decoupling.      |
| **Low traffic**           | A single instance can serve all functionality.       |

### ❌ Avoid When:

* You expect rapid **feature expansion**.
* App will scale massively or need high **availability**.
* You want **independent deployments**.

## 🔌 **2. SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)**

> A **middle ground** between Monolith and Microservices — services communicate over a **central Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)**.

### ✅ Best For:

| Scenario                        | Why SOA Is Suitable                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large enterprise apps**       | Good for integrating legacy systems and large modules.           |
| **Heterogeneous systems**       | Can connect systems in different tech stacks (Java, .NET, etc.). |
| **Interdepartmental platforms** | Allows different teams/apps to connect via the ESB.              |
| **Reusability of services**     | Centralized reusable services (e.g., auth, billing).             |

### ❌ Avoid When:

- You want **lightweight**, decentralized services.
- You need **high-speed communication** (ESB can be a bottleneck).
- Your system is **cloud-native** and needs dynamic scaling.

## 🧩 **3. Microservices Architecture**

### ✅ Best For:

| Scenario                        | Why Microservices Are Suitable                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large, complex applications** | Each module is developed and scaled independently.            |
| **Multiple development teams**  | Teams can work on different services without conflicts.       |
| **Frequent deployments**        | Individual services can be updated without downtime.          |
| **High scalability**            | Only scale the services that need it (e.g., payment, search). |
| **Cloud-native apps**           | Works best with containers, Kubernetes, CI/CD, etc.           |

### ❌ Avoid When:

- Team lacks experience in distributed systems.
- Project scope is small (adds unnecessary complexity).
- Monitoring, deployment, and testing setups aren’t ready.
