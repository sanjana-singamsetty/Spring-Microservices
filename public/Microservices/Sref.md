## üåü 1. What is **IoC (Inversion of Control)**?

### üìñ **Definition**:

> Inversion of Control means giving the control of creating and managing objects to a framework (like Spring), instead of doing it manually in your code.

---

### ü§î **Why is it called ‚ÄúInversion‚Äù?**

Normally **you control** when and how to create objects:

```java
Car car = new Car();
```

But in **IoC**, you **give control** to Spring. It decides:

- When to create the `Car` object
- How to inject its dependencies

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called **‚ÄúInversion of Control‚Äù** ‚Äî control is inverted from the programmer to the framework.

---

### üöó **Real-World Analogy**:

Think of building a car.

- **Without IoC**: You buy each part and build it yourself.
- **With IoC**: You go to a car manufacturer (Spring), tell them the type of car, and they build the entire car for you and hand it over ‚Äî ready to use.

---

## üíâ 2. What is **Dependency Injection (DI)?**

### üìñ **Definition**:

> DI is a design pattern where an object receives its dependencies from an external source (like Spring), instead of creating them itself.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Dependency Example**:

Imagine a `Car` class needs an `Engine` to work:

```java
public class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine(); // tightly coupled
}
```

This is bad because:

- You can't easily swap the `Engine` (no flexibility)
- It‚Äôs hard to test
- It's tightly coupled

---

### ‚úÖ **Better Way: Inject the Engine**

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

Now `Engine` is **injected from outside** ‚Äî this is **Constructor Injection**.

---

### üß† Spring DI in Action

```java
@Component
public class Engine {}

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

Spring automatically:

- Finds the `@Component` classes
- Creates the `Engine` object
- Injects it into `Car` using `@Autowired`

---

## üîå 3. What is **Autowiring**?

### üìñ **Definition**:

> Autowiring is the way Spring automatically injects dependencies into your classes using annotations like `@Autowired`.

---

### üîÑ **3 Types of Autowiring in Spring**

| Type                 | Description                  | Example                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Constructor**      | Inject via class constructor | `@Autowired public Car(Engine e)`    |
| **Setter**           | Inject via setter method     | `@Autowired public void setEngine()` |
| **Field** (not best) | Inject directly into field   | `@Autowired private Engine engine;`  |

---

### ‚ú® **Best Practice**: Use **Constructor Injection**

- Ensures immutability
- Easier to test
- Preferred by Spring team

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What if there are multiple beans?

Suppose you have two `Engine` beans:

```java
@Component
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {}

@Component
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {}
```

You must use `@Qualifier`:

```java
@Autowired
public Car(@Qualifier("dieselEngine") Engine engine) {
    this.engine = engine;
}
```

Or use `@Primary` on one bean:

```java
@Primary
@Component
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {}
```

---

## üß† Summary: Spring IoC vs DI vs Autowiring

| Concept              | Purpose                                  | Who does it | Key Feature                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| IoC                  | Framework controls object creation       | Spring      | You just declare what you need    |
| Dependency Injection | Injects required objects into your class | Spring      | Makes code decoupled & testable   |
| Autowiring           | Automatic way Spring performs DI         | Spring      | Uses `@Autowired` to do injection |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example to Tie Everything Together

```java
@Component
public class Engine {
    public String getType() {
        return "V8 Engine";
    }
}

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car running with " + engine.getType());
    }
}
```

Spring:

- Creates `Engine`
- Creates `Car`, injects `Engine` into it
- You just call `car.start()` and everything works

---

Absolutely! Let's break this down visually **with simple diagrams**, and explain all the **@ annotations** in the most beginner-friendly way. We'll cover:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Diagram: Inversion of Control + Dependency Injection**

```text
  You DON'T do this:
  -------------------
     Car
      |
      v
   creates
      |
      v
    Engine

Instead, with IoC + DI (Spring does this):
-------------------------------------------
   [Spring Container]
        |
        v
   Creates Engine
        |
        v
   Creates Car and injects Engine into it
```

üîÑ You no longer **create objects manually**. Spring **manages and injects** them for you!

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Main Annotations (`@`) and What They Do**

| Annotation       | Meaning                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@Component`     | Tells Spring: "I‚Äôm a class you should manage"                        |
| `@Autowired`     | Tells Spring: "Please inject my dependency here"                     |
| `@Service`       | Same as `@Component`, but used for **business logic**                |
| `@Repository`    | Same as `@Component`, but used for **database layer**                |
| `@Controller`    | Same as `@Component`, used for **handling HTTP requests**            |
| `@Configuration` | Tells Spring: "I‚Äôll provide manual bean configurations (advanced)"   |
| `@Bean`          | Used to manually register a bean in a config class                   |
| `@Qualifier`     | Helps Spring choose **which bean to inject** when there are multiple |
| `@Primary`       | Makes one bean the **default** if multiple beans of same type exist  |

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Simple Example with Diagram**

#### üß± Classes

```java
@Component
class Engine {
    public String getType() { return "Petrol Engine"; }
}
```

```java
@Component
class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Running with " + engine.getType());
    }
}
```

#### üß† What Spring Does Behind the Scenes

```text
   [Spring Boot App Starts]
          ‚Üì
  Finds @Component ‚Üí Engine ‚úÖ
  Finds @Component ‚Üí Car ‚úÖ
          ‚Üì
 Injects Engine ‚û° into ‚û° Car via @Autowired
```

Spring puts everything inside its "container", manages them, and connects them automatically for you!

```text
                    [Spring Container]
                         |

| `@Configuration`  | Declares class as **Java-based configuration**          | **Configuration Class** (provides `@Bean`s)                    |
| `@Bean`           | Declares a method return as a **Spring Bean**           | **Bean Definition via method**                                 |
| `@ComponentScan`  | Tells Spring which packages to scan                     | **Classpath Scanning**                                         |
| `@Value`          | Injects property values (e.g., from `.properties` file) | **Property Injection**                                         |
| `@PostConstruct`  | Runs a method **after bean creation**                   | **Bean Lifecycle Callback**                                    |

### ‚úÖ Visual Hierarchy of Stereotype Annotations

```text
             @Component
                 |
   ----------------------------------
   |              |               |
@Service     @Repository     @Controller
```

All of them **register the class as a Spring Bean**, but with **different semantic meaning** for better layer separation and tooling (like AOP, MVC, etc).

## üå± **Spring Framework Refresher ‚Äî Explained Simply**

Spring is a Java-based framework that helps you build modern web apps and enterprise-level applications easily and efficiently. It provides powerful features like **Dependency Injection**, **AOP**, **MVC**, **Security**, and more.

---

## üß† 1. **What is Spring?**

Spring is like a toolbox for Java developers. It gives you reusable tools and components so you don‚Äôt have to write everything from scratch.

---

## üí° 2. **Core Concepts**

### 2.1 ‚òï **Dependency Injection (DI)**

- Instead of creating objects manually in your code, Spring gives you the required objects automatically.
- This makes your code clean, decoupled, and testable.

**Example:**

```java
public class Car {
   Engine engine;

   public Car(Engine engine) {
      this.engine = engine;
   }
}
```

Spring injects the `Engine` object into `Car` so you don‚Äôt have to write `engine = new Engine()`.

---

### 2.2 üå± **Beans**

- Any class managed by Spring is called a "bean".
- Beans are created, configured, and managed by the Spring container.

You declare a class as a bean using:

```java
@Component
public class MyService {}
```

---

### 2.3 üè° **ApplicationContext (Container)**

- It‚Äôs like a factory that holds all your beans and provides them when needed.

Spring starts up, looks at your code/config files, and builds a "context" that knows about all your services, repositories, etc.

---

### 2.4 üîß **Configuration**

You can configure beans using:

- `@ComponentScan` (to scan packages)
- `@Configuration` + `@Bean` (manual config)
- `application.properties` (settings like port, DB URL, etc.)

---

## üåê 3. **Spring MVC (Model View Controller)**

Used to build **web applications and REST APIs**.

### Key Parts:

| Part       | What it does                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Controller | Handles HTTP requests (URLs)  |
| Service    | Business logic (process data) |
| Repository | Talks to the database         |
| Model      | Represents your data          |

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/students")
public class StudentController {

   @GetMapping
   public List<Student> getAllStudents() {
       return studentService.getAllStudents();
   }
}
```

---

## üîó 4. **Spring Boot**

Spring Boot makes it super easy to build Spring apps.

‚úÖ Auto-configures most things
‚úÖ Has embedded Tomcat server
‚úÖ You can just run the app using `main()`
‚úÖ Comes with lots of built-in starters like `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`

---

## üßæ 5. **Spring Data JPA**

Used to interact with databases easily.

- You define an interface like:

```java
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {}
```

- You get all CRUD operations automatically:

  - `save()`, `findById()`, `deleteById()`

---

## üîí 6. **Spring Security (Basics)**

Helps protect your web apps and REST APIs with login, JWT, OAuth2, etc.

With Spring Security, you can:

- Protect routes (`/admin`, `/user`)
- Add login forms or JWT tokens
- Add role-based access

---

## ‚úâÔ∏è 7. **Spring REST APIs**

To build REST APIs, you use:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/products")
public class ProductController {

   @GetMapping
   public List<Product> getAll() {
       return productService.findAll();
   }

   @PostMapping
   public Product create(@RequestBody Product p) {
       return productService.save(p);
   }
}
```

---

## üí• 8. **Exception Handling**

Use `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` to handle errors globally.

---

## üß™ 9. **Testing**

You can test Spring apps using:

- `@SpringBootTest`
- `@WebMvcTest` for controllers
- `@DataJpaTest` for DB layer

---

## üß∞ 10. **Useful Annotations**

| Annotation        | Purpose                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `@Component`      | Mark a class as a Spring Bean |
| `@Autowired`      | Inject a dependency           |
| `@RestController` | REST controller               |
| `@Service`        | Business logic layer          |
| `@Repository`     | DB layer                      |
| `@Entity`         | JPA entity (DB table)         |
| `@GetMapping`     | HTTP GET                      |
| `@PostMapping`    | HTTP POST                     |

---

## üß≠ Summary

Spring helps with:

- Clean code via DI
- Fast development via Spring Boot
- Easy web/API creation via Spring MVC
- Easy DB use via Spring Data
- Secure apps via Spring Security
