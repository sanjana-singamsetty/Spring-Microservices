# üß© What are Microservices?

**Microservices** is a software architecture style where an application is **divided into small, independent services**, each responsible for a **specific functionality**, and all services communicate over APIs (typically HTTP or messaging queues).

Each microservice:

* Has its own codebase
* Can be deployed independently
* Can use its own database (optional)
* Handles a specific domain/business capability

---

## üîç Simple Definition

> Microservices = Breaking a big application into **smaller, loosely-coupled**, and **independently deployable** services.

---

## üì¶ Real-World Example: E-Commerce App

Instead of one big app, you split it into services like:

| Microservice           | Responsibility                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `User Service`         | Manages user registration, login   |
| `Product Service`      | Handles product listing, inventory |
| `Order Service`        | Places and manages orders          |
| `Payment Service`      | Manages payment processing         |
| `Notification Service` | Sends emails/SMS                   |

Each can be:

- Developed by different teams
- Scaled individually
- Deployed at different times

Client  --->    | API Gateway   | ---> | Auth Service      |
                +---------------+      +------------------+
                        |                    |
                        v                    v
               +---------------+     +------------------+
               | Product Service|     | Order Service     |
               +---------------+     +------------------+
                        |
                        v
               +------------------+
               | Payment Service  |
               +------------------+

Each service has its own database and is independently deployable.

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Microservices

| Benefit                    | Why it‚Äôs good                                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**            | Scale only what‚Äôs needed (e.g., just Product Service)     |
| **Independent Deployment** | No need to redeploy whole app if only one service changes |
| **Tech Flexibility**       | Use different tech stacks for different services          |
| **Fault Isolation**        | Failure in one service doesn‚Äôt crash the whole app        |
| **Faster Development**     | Teams can work in parallel on different services          |

## ‚ùå Challenges of Microservices

| Challenge                  | Explanation                                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complex communication**  | Needs API contracts and inter-service communication            |
| **Data consistency**       | Managing transactions across services is tricky                |
| **Deployment complexity**  | More services = more things to deploy & monitor                |
| **Monitoring & Debugging** | Needs central logging and tracing (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana) |

## üõ† Common Tools in Microservices

| Tool Type        | Tools/Tech Used                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| API Gateway      | NGINX, Zuul, Kong              |
| Communication    | REST, gRPC, Kafka, RabbitMQ    |
| Containerization | Docker                         |
| Orchestration    | Kubernetes                     |
| CI/CD            | Jenkins, GitHub Actions        |
| Monitoring       | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack |

## ‚úÖ When to Use Microservices

- App is growing large and hard to manage
- Multiple teams are working in parallel
- You need to scale parts independently
- You want faster feature delivery
