Microservices communicate with each other through **inter-process communication (IPC)** mechanisms, since each microservice typically runs as an independent process (often in its own container or server). Here's a breakdown of the **main communication mechanisms** used in microservices:

---

## üîÑ **1. Synchronous Communication**

### ‚úÖ Used when:

- You need an **immediate response**
- Strong **request‚Äìresponse** pattern is required

### üõ† Common Mechanisms:

#### a. **HTTP/REST APIs**

- Most common method
- Services expose RESTful endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- Communicates over HTTP using JSON or XML

**Example**:

```http
GET /user/123
‚Üí Returns: { "name": "Sanjana", "email": "..." }
```

#### b. **gRPC**

- Uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)
- Faster and more compact than REST
- Supports streaming and strong typing

**Use case**: Real-time systems or internal services that need performance.

## üì© **2. Asynchronous Communication**

### ‚úÖ Used when:

- You don‚Äôt need an **immediate response**
- You want to decouple services and improve fault tolerance

### üõ† Common Mechanisms:

#### a. **Message Queues**

- Services send messages to a queue, and other services consume them
- Enables **event-driven** architecture

**Popular Tools**:

- **RabbitMQ**
- **Amazon SQS**
- **ActiveMQ**

**Example**:

- `OrderService` sends a "NewOrderPlaced" message to a queue
- `InventoryService` consumes it and updates stock

#### b. **Event Streaming**

- Services publish events to a log that other services subscribe to

**Popular Tools**:

- **Apache Kafka**
- **Amazon Kinesis**
- **Redis Streams**

**Use case**: High-throughput, real-time processing (e.g., analytics, monitoring).

## üåê **3. Service Mesh (Advanced Internal Communication)**

Used to **abstract service-to-service communication**, often within Kubernetes.

### üõ† Tools:

- **Istio**
- **Linkerd**
- **Consul Connect**

**Features**:

- Handles retries, timeouts, mTLS (secure communication), observability
- Separates business logic from communication logic
